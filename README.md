# myLeagues-Ionic

MyLeagues is the way to keep track of who is the top dog in your friend group.

Whether its something as simple as Ping Pong or 1 v 1 Basketball, MyLeagues helps you see your ranking amongst your piers. It functions just like any Fantasy Sports league youve ever participated in, but instead of professional players determining the outcome, you are in control. Whenever you compete in any sort of competition, you can now record the result of that matchup for all of your friends to see. Utilize the following features in your question to become #1:

-Simple, yet intuitive UI to record your games
-A Leaderboard that evaluates members of a league based on their winning percentage as well as number of games played
-Personal profiles to show how you rank among your fellow competitors from an offensive and defensive perspective
-Game history to see where you hit your stride in route to the top of the leaderboard
-Customizable profiles and leagues to express yourself outside the games
